# Weather app

Small hobby project. Will get weather from some weather stations. Caches data in API and emit changes through socket.io to a svelte frontend.

The API will read .txt files generated by [Weather Display](https://www.weather-display.com) and emit on changes. First run will emit the full JSON object.

Work in progress.
